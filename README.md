# Mockup Design to Live Responsive Website
This project is my first responsive website using HTML picture element and CSS flex property.

The assignment was to create a responsive website that looks like the mockup design on an one page PDF.

Since the assignment did not supply the images and asked the students to use custom images, I used images from an image placeholder site.  I plan on updating this project with my own images instead of using placeholder images.
