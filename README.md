# project_01_responsive
My first responsive website using HTML picture element and CSS flex property.

In this project, the assignment was to create a responsive website that looks like the mockup website that was designed on an one page PDF. The mockup PDF has a logo at the top left corner, an identity header on the right corner, a large banner or hero image in the center, and three small thumbnail images aligned in a row on the bottom. Since the assignment asked for custom images, I used images from an image placeholder site.  I've passed the assignment, and I've uploaded the files to github as the first commit. 

I plan on updating this project with my own custom images and links to my future projects.

# To-Do
